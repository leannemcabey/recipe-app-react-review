Deliverables:

1) As a user, I should see all categories on page load on the left column

2) When I click on “find recipes”, I should see the middle column populate with recipes from that category

3) When I click on a recipe in the middle column, I should add a REFERENCE (not the entire object, just an unique identifier) to my recipes, and this recipe should appear in the right most column

4) When I click on a recipe in the right column, this should remove the recipe from my recipes

5) When I type in the filter box, I should filter the categories by name
